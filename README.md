    Worth Mentioning
      Severly changing the format of the input csv including the order of columns will break everything.
    Biography
      I had never programmed in Python before this project.  I have never studied computer science.  I would not have applied to this program except that I was invided by a very nice Kyree.  I hope my habits and practices aren't too offensive or egregious.  Having spent two full days working on this, I fell inclined to thank you for a chance to push myself way outside my comfort zone.  I am very proud of what I made and I look forward to hearing what you think of it.
